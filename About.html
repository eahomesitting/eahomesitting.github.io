        <p style="font-family: sans-serif">Hi! I am Evan Anderson a freshmen at Snohomish High Shcool. The point of this website is an entrepreneurship SAE project for my<br>
        plant biology class. I have always liked the idea of house/pet
        sitting because it gives me a chance to prove how responsible I can be if it means a lot to me. <br> I take paypal through my site, accepted anytime after the job! But if you dont in the first 24 hours I will send a text to make sure you get on that soon! <br> 3 days is the max I am willing to take, I will not stay at your house over night. I will leave by midnight and come back the next day, <br> on weekends I will be back sometime between 12pm and 1pm weekdays I will leave by 8pm and come back sometime between 4-5pm. I will text you to confirm I made it if you ask me too. </p></center>
